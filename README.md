# Code Review

Code review written by [Johanna Pihl](https://github.com/username).

1. `index.php:52-54` - Just remember that there is a html tag named header that you can use instead of a div to make things easier.
2. `functions.php:31` - Would be helpful with just a short comment on how the function works.
3. `functions.php:08` - Could be usefull to have clearer argument variables.
4. `index.php:36-48` - This bit of code could be put in a function or a different document to make the html look a bit cleaner.
5. `functions.php:70-88` - Again would be helpfull to just have a short explanation of the function just so you are not confused when you return to the code later.
    <br>But the webbsite looks really cool, was very fun to use and you did a very good job with it!üëç
